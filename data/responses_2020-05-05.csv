In the crease of my chin is where I get it the most, and it's typically small and cystic-like, and maybe 1-3 bumps at a time. I also get dry patches on my chin too that drive me nuts because they feel so much different than the rest of my skin. I sought out a dermatologist about 10-11 years ago for help with acne, and none of the treatments she prescribed me worked, which at the time totally soured my view on dermatology for acne treatments. In fact, they all dried my skin completely out, even at the lowest possible doses, made it flake off and turn red, and I had to wear Vaseline as a moisturizer for a week or two because everything else was too painful to apply (and I was starting a new job when all this happened, yay me).

Fast forward to now: I don't wash my face every day, I rarely wear make up, I'm not particularly oily/sweaty, and I keep my face out of the sun, but as a fair-skinned person, any area of redness or irritation pops out and is really noticeable on my skin. I am not looking for a 10 step skin care routine, so keeping it simple is really important to me. I'm also not terribly unhappy with my skin, in fact it's probably the best it's ever been now, but I want to keep it happy and healthy for as long as I can and prepare for future hormonal and/or age related changes. My biggest issue right now aside from hormonal acne is my under eye area, it tends to be dark and either sunken in or puffy (I am working on keeping myself properly hydrated from the inside too!) so I alternate between looking tired/almost dead because of my skin tone or like I've been crying, and eye creams don't really help much.",Yes

If I notice a pimple developing over the course of the day, I pop an Avarelle pimple patch on it.

On Friday mornings I do an intensive exfoliating treatment after cleansing- have been using Aveeno MaxGlow Peel Off Mask, but ran out recently and switched to Peter Thomas Roth Pumpkin Enzyme mask (which is amaaaaazing). I follow that with a hydrating mask- I've been using Kiehl's Calendula 5 minute hydrating mask, which replaced the Bliss honey mask when I ran out last month.","First cleanse with Garnier Mattifying Micellar Water, second cleanse with OleHenriksen Oil Control Cleanser (was using Cetaphil Gentle Foaming cleanser, but experienced some irritation), serum is OleHenriksen Night Transformation Gel.

I mask a couple evenings a week after cleansing- I use the Kiehl's Calendula mask if I'm feeling dry, or a Dr. Jart clay to cleanser mask if my skin is flaring up (I have the set of the Dr. Jart masks, so there's pink clay, green clay, and white clay.

I've only ever had one prescription acne treatment- Clindamyacin- in high school. For a while, birth control was my natural acne fighter. When I switched contraception methods four years ago, my skin tanked, and two years ago was when I really started trying to control my breakouts. For me, the introduction of glycolic acid (in transformation gel and masks) and benzoyl peroxide (in Antibac) over the last year and a half has been revolutionary for my skin. It used to be so congested and irritated, but the frequent exfoliation and then benzoyl to root out bacteria have really helped clear it up.","I started getting into skincare with gusto at the end of November 2018, so it's been about 1.5 years of really nailing down my routine and figuring out what steps I need. I still get hormonal acne, and the occasional pustules. My biggest concern now is controlling those large pimples and dealing with scarring/skin tone. It seems that every time I notice a significant improvement in my skin, something changes and I'm back to doing damage control. I'd love any insights on my routine and what could upgrade or replace a part of it!

As you may notice, I oscillate pretty dramatically between drying ingredients and hydrating ingredients. Not sure the effects of that, but I got very dry this past winter and stocked up on the HydroBoost in January to try to counteract that.

I've also been on a consistent course of oral contraceptives since then.
