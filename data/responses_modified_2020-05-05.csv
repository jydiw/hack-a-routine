I did try either an AHA or BHA toner a long time ago that dried my skin out and made it red.","When I do have acne, it usually occurs during my menstrual cycle. In the crease of my chin is where I get it the most, and it's typically small and cystic-like, and maybe 1-3 bumps at a time. I also get dry patches on my chin too that drive me nuts because they feel so much different than the rest of my skin. I sought out a dermatologist about 10-11 years ago for help with acne, and none of the treatments she prescribed me worked, which at the time totally soured my view on dermatology for acne treatments. In fact, they all dried my skin completely out, even at the lowest possible doses, made it flake off and turn red, and I had to wear Vaseline as a moisturizer for a week or two because everything else was too painful to apply (and I was starting a new job when all this happened, yay me). She had me on Differin gel and Aczone and I had to stop using both because my skin fell off and she was incredibly surprised by my skin's reaction to these products. ","As I have gotten older (I'm 35), the less I do to my face in terms of products or a skincare routine, the better it seems to do, so I want whatever I am using to count. When I was a teenager, I was using all kinds of St. Ives apricot scrubs, Noxzema, Clean & Clear, and Sea Breeze (it's a wonder I still have skin left!) Fast forward to now: I don't wash my face every day, I rarely wear make up, I'm not particularly oily/sweaty, and I keep my face out of the sun, but as a fair-skinned person, any area of redness or irritation pops out and is really noticeable on my skin. I am not looking for a 10 step skin care routine, so keeping it simple is really important to me. I'm also not terribly unhappy with my skin, in fact it's probably the best it's ever been now, but I want to keep it happy and healthy for as long as I can and prepare for future hormonal and/or age related changes. My biggest issue right now aside from hormonal acne is my under eye area, it tends to be dark and either sunken in or puffy (I am working on keeping myself properly hydrated from the inside too!) so I alternate between looking tired/almost dead because of my skin tone or like I've been crying, and eye creams don't really help much.",Yes

I've only ever had one prescription acne treatment- Clindamyacin- in high school. For a while, birth control was my natural acne fighter. When I switched contraception methods four years ago, my skin tanked, and two years ago was when I really started trying to control my breakouts. For me, the introduction of glycolic acid (in transformation gel and masks) and benzoyl peroxide (in Antibac) over the last year and a half has been revolutionary for my skin. It used to be so congested and irritated, but the frequent exfoliation and then benzoyl to root out bacteria have really helped clear it up.","I started getting into skincare with gusto at the end of November 2018, so it's been about 1.5 years of really nailing down my routine and figuring out what steps I need. I still get hormonal acne, and the occasional pustules. My biggest concern now is controlling those large pimples and dealing with scarring/skin tone. It seems that every time I notice a significant improvement in my skin, something changes and I'm back to doing damage control. I'd love any insights on my routine and what could upgrade or replace a part of it!

As you may notice, I oscillate pretty dramatically between drying ingredients and hydrating ingredients. Not sure the effects of that, but I got very dry this past winter and stocked up on the HydroBoost in January to try to counteract that.

Have also briefly tried Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Peel (glycolic, salicylic and lactic acids, concentration unsure) and Peter Thomas Roth Max Complexion Correction Pads (10% glycolic, 2% salicylic), both extremely irritating and broke me out. Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant was mildly irritating/very drying, and saw no improvement after continued use. Have occasionally used spot treatment salicylic acid of varying intensities and formulations since I was a teenager, usually just dries out a pimple and makes the surrounding skin incredibly flaky. ","Very prone. Hormonal (or accidentally ingesting any dairy products) breakouts mostly occur in small/medium cysts around my mouth and chin; if I react to a product, ingest too much sugar/alcohol or experience some environmental irritant small red bumps can appear anywhere. All my breakouts are less severe now; dermatologist ~2 years ago prescribed oral Spironolactone (which I have taken more or less daily since) and .025% retinol which I use 1-2x a week. I've also been on a consistent course of oral contraceptives since then. Before that, since high school I tried everything dermatologists prescribed to me, including but not limited to oral antibiotics, topical clindamycin, Differin, sulfur, and a course of Accutane, which I stopped halfway through because of severe depressive side effects, joint pain, and painful skin dryness. ","I would most love to address the battleground of scars on my face, and figure out why it seems every pimple leaves pigmentation in its place, and often times pitted scars. My breakouts have grown less severe since I began the Spironolactone, but I am left with incredibly dry skin, little dents all over my face (mostly on my cheeks and jawline), and after stopping Accutane (which I tried about 4 years ago) began to feel that my skin no longer knew how to exfoliate itself, if that makes sense? So it's dry, but also I imagine I can ~feel~ a layer of flaky dead skin over my face, such that products meant to hydrate rarely seem to sink in properly. As I wrote above, I've tried many kinds of exfoliators and products meant to get rid of flakiness (which is a constant issue, especially wearing makeup) but they mostly seem to irritate my skin more.

I have also tried The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder (mixed into face moisturizer) but not consistently and I think supposedly it conflicts with the Niacinamide in my cleanser so I was trying to alternate when using that.","Not usually, but I do experience hormonal acne at times. Concentrated on my chin, sometimes my cheek. Usually 1-3 pimples at a time. Sometimes I notice oily skin throughout the day with makeup on. Historically with pimples, I use pimple patches to treat and avoid over moisturizing those areas until they clear. Old pimples have left dark spots contributing to an uneven skin tone.","Not entirely sure my order of skincare is correct.
